### IDEAS FOR FDA PROJECT ###
#       1) See if I can predict number of adverse events based on labeling
#       2) Look to see if certain drugs have types of adverse events
#       3) Do adverse events happen to certain types of people?
#       4) Does the severity of label language have impact? / Can I categorize it?
#       5) Can we predict adverse events at all?
